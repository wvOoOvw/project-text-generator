const train = `中国的发展从古至今已经有六十年多了，一直秉持着社会主义的发展是中国的独有特色。相比与其他国家的资本主义发展，中国坚定不移地以社会主义发展为发展宗旨，这一行为看似简单实施起来则是困难。这对于国家领导人的能力更是一种挑战，在毛泽东带领之下的中国不断地快速发展，并且不忘社会主义的初衷，以人人为我、我为人人的群众思想发展。这是我国特色社会主义理论的雏形。习近平也在多次的公开演讲中说到，中国依旧会坚持社会主义发展进行建设，不忘初心是中国发展首要目标。可见特色社会主义理论对于中国的发展起到了很大的作用，民心所向决定了一个国家是否兴盛。然而社会主义发展正是注重群众的想法，与资本主义不同，不会将金钱和其他硬性指标作为国家发展的唯一标准线，社会主义更加致力于取悦群众的需求。这么一种民心所向的国家发展方向致使了中国可以变成现在这么的国际大国，中国特色社会主义理论从毛泽东领导时到现在的习近平领导从没有断过，中国的发展沿袭了毛泽东那个年代时定下的发展目标。中国特色社会主义理论的价值体现在国家的建设以及群众的思想，首先在国家的建设上，因为我国是社会主义国家所以党的思想、领导人的执政，这些都是要以群众的利益为出发点而去行为，与资本主义不同，不能为了国家的发展而舍弃了群众的自由或者是利益。其次从群众的思想上来说，社会主义代表着我为人人、人人为我的思想，国家的建设过程中不断地对群众灌输社会主义的思想也是建设的内容之一。只有当一个国家的群众都是为了社会的发展和共同的利益而行为时，国家才能真正达到社会主义的层次，取得更好的发展。所以，中国特色社会主义理论对于中国的发展起到了很大的作用，也是中国发展必不可缺的理论，其拥有着很高的价值。

马克思主义是由马克思和恩格斯创设的，在两人经过了无数次的实践之后，创建出了这套理论，在理论中有很多关于国家建设相关的理论。中国社会主义发展是从古至今一直都坚持的发展行为，由毛泽东创立了中华人民共和国到今已有六十多年，从未放弃过建设一个社会主义的中国。马克思主义在我国初期就开始帮助我国发展，从古至今马克思主义一直是我国发展的同时坚持的理论。马克思主义和中国的社会主义建设是有关联的，在马克思主义中不断地有提到关于社会主义的理论，这也是为什么毛泽东在创立中华人民共和国之初就选定了马克思主义为我国发展的指南针。这就是说明了马克思主义与中国发展国情有交集，并且中国发展是要依靠马克思主义作为基石发展的。不得不说，马克思主义在我国社会主义建设的道路上帮助了很多，不仅仅是国家设备的建设，更多的是人民群众内心思想的建设。在马克思主义中很多的理论都是偏向于思想的建设，国家内的群众拥有一个良好的思想是一个国家建设成功的基础。所以说，马克思主义与中国六十多年的建设发展是不可分的，习近平不断地在座谈会中表示，中国未来的发展还是会依照马克思主义进行发展，尽管时代有变革，但是马克思主义中的理论是可以随时代而演变的，所以中国的发展还是会以马克思主义为基础而发展。可见马克思主义的重要性，中国不能舍弃马克思主义而独立发展，社会主义的发展也是需要马克思理论所支持的。

在了解了许多关于马克思主义和中国特色社会主义之后，我感到一个国家的发展是如此的不易，不仅仅在国家基础农业、工业、服务业这些硬性的指标上。更加需要国家领导人和我们国民共同努力的是中国的社会主义建设，这是一道对于中国的大难关。因为中国一直坚持社会主义建设，而在世界上已经少有社会主义的国家，大都是资本主义国家，这也就导致了中国难免会和资本主义国家产生矛盾。现如今中国与其他国家的政治方针不同而引发了很多贸易问题，导致了中国内部的贸易出现了大难关。这时候正是需要我们国民一起帮助中国渡过这一大难关，国家领导人习近平在座谈会以及公共场合上表达了对于中国以后的建设依旧会沿袭之前社会主义的建设，不会放弃马克思主义、社会主义。这个硬性的态度表示着中国对于社会主义建设的决心，我们群众更加需要加把劲，为了中国更好的未来应该奉献出自己。我觉得中国之所以有现在这么强大的实力，离不开马克思主义和社会主义建设，正所谓，一个国家的兴亡取决于民，群众在国家中的地位应该是最高的，因为国家的形成是由人民形成的。倘若一个国家的政策和思想都不是为了人民着想的，那么人民肯定会气愤而导致国家的灭亡。因为中国一直坚持以人民群众为首要考虑目标，其次才是国家的利益，这一行为是中国建设的主要思想，所以人民会拥戴中国、与中国共同努力。不管是马克思主义、中国社会主义发展，这些都是以国家中的人民的利益为主的发展方针，可见民心的重要性。习近平在领导我国的时候也是不断地为群众考虑，而不是仅仅考虑了国家的利益和发展，这是中国领导人应该做到的事情，为了中国以后的社会主义发展而去做到的事情。群众和领导人一样也应该去多多地帮助别人，不要只想到自己的利益而忽视了我国社会主义纲要。

马克思主义作为我国发展了六十余载之久的核心思想理论之一，其中的道理和思想一直被我国人民群众所认同，不同的国家领导人也时常地提及马克思主义与我国的发展是密不可分的。在我国六十多年的发展期间里，马克思主义扮演着一个给我国发展导航的角色。因为我国是社会主义国家，在发展的道路上难免会与资本主义国家发展往来，也因此我国的发展道路会受到偏移。但国家领导人们始终坚信着马克思主义的理论，将中国的发展与马克思主义相结合，始终对社会主义发展抱有积极的态度，这也就造就了现在的中国。现在处于信息科技的时代，不断地创新以及信息技术的发展都是一个国家生命力的体现，习近平也在座谈会上说到国家的发展还是要注重马克思理论，马克思理论是国家发展的基石，在创新之下也要秉持着马克思理论其中的原理。因为马克思理论不是一套一成不变的理论，其中的道理和理论都是随着时代的变化而被人理解成不同的思想观念的。这一点也造就了中国可以在不同的时代中有不同的发展目标，所以马克思主义和中国的发展是密不可分的。马克思主义中许多的理论都是在前人经过了无数次的实践之后而得出的，这些理论是无可挑剔的，是可以供后人在任意的场合使用的。也因为如此，中国的国情发展离不开马克思主义，社会主义发展的趋势不会发生偏移也是因为马克思主义中的理论知识。所以说，中国的发展在马克思主义的帮助下经过六十多年的奋斗逐渐成型，现在已经是世界大国，归根结底还是要感谢马克思主义可以在中国的发展方针上树立起正面的影响。在中国以后的发展中，正如习近平所说，依然会继续坚持马克思主义的理论而继续发展中国，在不忘初心、不忘马克思主义的前提之下，进行创新型发展。这样的目的也是为了让中国可以在社会主义发展的道路上不要越走越远，可以将中国发展为一个为任命服务的国家是中国发展的初心。

习近平一番话让我感到了中国发展的不易，经历了六十多年的时间长河才成就了现在的中国，这是一件多么不容易的事情。在中国发展的道路上有许许多多的曲折和坎坷，在一直秉持着相信马克思主义的理念之下持续发展才能成为现在这样的中国。我觉得中国的发展是离不开马克思主义其中的理论的，这是毛泽东、习近平这些国家领导人的智慧，只有将一个正确积极的理论用在国家建设上才能使国家的发展迅速、不偏移。国家领导人的慧眼使中国与马克思主义在中国成立到现在始终没有分离，现在中国已经是世界大国，就这一点可以证明当初中国刚成立时，国家领导人们选定了马克思主义作为中国发展的基石是完全正确的。之所以中国可以发展得如此迅速以及积极，不仅仅是国家领导人们的功劳，最重要的是马克思主义帮助了中国许多，就像这次习近平在座谈会上说的，马克思主义是中国一直坚持的东西，不仅仅是以往坚持的，以后还是会一直坚持马克思主义。马克思主义中有许多适合中国发展的正确理论，中国是一个社会主义国家，所以正符合了马克思主义中基础的发展理论。中国始终是要做到为人民服务的，在许多的条条款款中都是力争做到为人民着想、为人民服务，不像其他的资本主义国家那么唯利是图。所以在中国的发展方针中也极其注意民心和群众的焦点，无时无地地观察着民心的动向，为的就是能够在什么时候都可以帮助群众解决问题，帮助群众在曲折上给出援手。最后我认为中国的发展到现在为止都是很好的，在有一个好的国家领导人的带领之下，中国的发展蒸蒸日上，群众对中国发展的响应也是叫好连篇。在未来的长河中，中国也应该像现在这样不断地发展但又不忘初心，可以做到为人民服务。

马克思主义是马克思主义理论体系的简称，是关于全世界无产阶级和全人类彻底解放的学说。它由马克思主义哲学、马克思主义政治经济学和科学社会主义三大部分组成，是马克思、恩格斯在批判地继承和吸收人类关于自然科学、思维科学、社会科学优秀成果的基础上于19世纪40年代创立的，并在实践中不断地丰富、发展和完善的无产阶级思想的科学体系。马克思主义是我们立党立国、兴党兴国的根本指导思想。实践告诉我们，中国共产党为什么能，中国特色社会主义为什么好，归根到底是马克思主义行，是中国化时代化的马克思主义行。拥有马克思主义科学理论指导是我们党坚定信仰信念、把握历史主动的根本所在。推进马克思主义中国化时代化是一个追求真理、揭示真理、笃行真理的过程。

从不同的角度，我们可以对什么是马克思主义作出不同的回答。从它的创造者、继承者的认识成果讲，马克思主义是由马克思恩格斯创立的，而由其后各个时代、各个民族的马克思主义者不断丰富和发展的观点和学说的体系。从它的阶级属性讲，马克思主义是无产阶级争取自身解放和整个人类解放的科学理论，是关于无产阶级斗争的性质、目的和解放条件的学说。从它的研究对象和主要内容讲，马克思主义是无产阶级的科学世界观和方法论，是关于自然、社会和思维发展的普遍规律的学说。马克思主义是由一系列的基本理论、基本观点和基本方法构成的科学体系，它是一个完整的体系。其中，马克思主义哲学、马克思主义政治经济学和科学社会主义，是马克思主义理论体系不可分割的三个主要组成部分。马克思主义这一概念早在马克思在世时就已经使用。从狭义上说，马克思主义即马克思恩格斯创立的基本理论、基本观点和学说的体系。至于为什么以马克思的名字命名这一理论，恩格斯在1886年曾经作了说明。他说：“我不能否认，我和马克思共同工作40年，在这以前和这个期间，我在一定程度上独立地参加了这一理论的创立，特别是对这一理论的阐发。但是，绝大部分基本指导思想，尤其是对这些指导思想的最后的明确的表述，都是属于马克思的。我所提供的，马克思没有我也能够做到，至多有几个专门的领域除外。至于马克思所做到的，我却做不到。马克思比我们大家都站得高些，看的远些，观察得多些和快些。马克思是天才，我们至多是能手。没有马克思，我们的理论远不会是现在这个样子。所以，这个理论用他的名字命名是理所当然的。”从广义上说，马克思主义不仅指马克思恩格斯创立的基本原理论、基本观点论和学说体系，也包括继承者对它的发展，及在实践中不断的发展着的马克思主义。作为中国共产党和社会主义事业指导思想的马克思主义，是从广义上理解的马克思主义。它既包括由马克思恩格斯创立的马克思主义的基本理论、基本观点、基本方法，也包括经列宁等对其继承和发展，推进到新的阶段，并由毛泽东、邓小平、江泽民、胡锦涛、习近平等为主要代表的中国共产党人将其与中国具体实际相结合，进一步丰富和发展了马克思主义，即中国化的马克思主义。

无产阶级专政的学说是马克思主义的精髓。他们同时指出，无产阶级必须通过暴力革命，粉碎资产阶级专政，建立无产阶级专政，并在向共产主义社会过渡的整个历史时期中巩固和加强无产阶级专政。为了建立和巩固无产阶级专政，必须有共产主义政党的领导。马克思主义是在各式各样资产阶级和小资产阶级反动思潮、同国际工人运动中各种机会主义、修正主义的反复斗争中发展和壮大起来的。在第一国际时期，马克思、恩格斯同蒲鲁东派、巴枯宁派、工联派、拉萨尔派进行了毫不妥协的原则斗争。通过这些斗争，马克思主义在国际工人运动中确立了统治地位。另外，当代西方马克思主义还对其哲学分别做了科学主义和人本主义的角度的解读。由于马克思学说涉及领域之广，使得社会学、政治学等学科分别都在自己的领域内对其进行阐释，因此还可以根据学科分工考察其内容。马克思主义一词作为马克思、恩格斯创立的学说的总称在马克思在世时已经出现，在19世纪70年代末法国社会主义者的著作中曾广泛使用，但内容受到歪曲，马克思对此提出尖锐批评。恩格斯在80年代初开始使用马克思主义一词，并在1886年专门作了说明。`
